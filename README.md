### About the App
* The app allows Financial Advisors to keep track of the clients under them as well as the scheduled meeting with their 
clients.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion** and provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* Example usages:
  * Allows Financial Advisors to add new clients, delete existing clients
